**Simple logging and monitoring platform for modern applications** 📊

## 🎯 Why Logger Simple?

Tired of applications crashing in production with **no error logs**? Frustrated with hosting providers that don't record critical errors when your app goes down? 

**Logger Simple was born from this exact frustration.**

When your application crashes on most hosting platforms, you're left in the dark - no stack traces, no error context, no clues about what went wrong. Logger Simple solves this by providing a **reliable, external logging service** that captures everything, even when your main application fails.
